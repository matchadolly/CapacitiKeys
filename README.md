# CapacitiKeys
An Alfred workflow: Dinky doodads to (maybe) improve your Capacities.io experience.

## Prerequisites
- A [Capacities.io](https://capacities.io) account on the Pro or Believer plan (required for API access).
- The ID of the space you'd like to search and add weblinks to. It's found in Capacities under Settings → Space Settings → Space ID.
- Your API token. Generate one in Capacities in Settings → Capacities API. A Pro or Believer plan is required for API access.

## Setup
1. Download the latest [.alfredworkflow release](https://github.com/matchadolly/CapacitiKeys/releases).
2. Double click the downloaded file. It should open directly in Alfred.
3. Configure the workflow by filling in the values listed below, then click Install.
    1. Required:
        1. Space ID.
        2. API token.
    2. Optional:
        1. Keyword for searching Capacities (default: cs)
        2. Keyword for adding a weblink (default: cw)
        3. Whether you'd like links to open in the Capacities desktop app or in your default browser.
4. Initalise the workflow by running the "cset" action.
    1. Open the Alfred launcher and type in the keyword "cset".
    2. Select the action "Set object types" and wait until "Object types loaded" shows up.
5. You are ALL SET!!

## Usage
### [Search Capacities](https://github.com/matchadolly/CapacitiKeys/blob/f472cbc7dc1a5b285963ad550b6da3ab331ec946/Search%20Capacities)
Type your chosen _keyword_ followed by your search query, e.g. "_cs_ python". The matching objects will be displayed, with the object type listed underneath. Click on an object to open it in the app or browser, depending on what you choose in the config.
### [Add weblink](https://github.com/matchadolly/CapacitiKeys/blob/f472cbc7dc1a5b285963ad550b6da3ab331ec946/Add%20weblink)
Type your chosen _keyword_ followed by the weblink, e.g. "_cw_ https://github.com/". Press enter to send the weblink to Capacities. If no input is provided, the workflow will attempt to get the URL of the front browser; if a weblink still cannot be obtained, the workflow will attempt to get the weblink from your clipboard. Note that your input or your clipboard, if you did not provide an input, will have to contain just the URL and nothing else for the workflow to work.
### [Set object types (cset)](https://github.com/matchadolly/CapacitiKeys/blob/f472cbc7dc1a5b285963ad550b6da3ab331ec946/Set%20object%20types)
This just has to be run once when the workflow is first installed, or when you create a new object type. As mentioned above: Open the Alfred launcher and type in the keyword "cset". Select the action "Set object types" and wait until "Object types loaded" shows up. If search results have an object type with a random string of numbers and letters, it's probably because you haven't run this yet.
